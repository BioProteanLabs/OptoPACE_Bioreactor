Abstract:
Continuous culture systems are essential for synthetic biology techniques like Directed Evolution (DE) and Phage-Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE), which require metabolically active bacterial cultures for extended periods. Turbidostats, which maintain cell density using real-time optical density (OD) feedback, offer ideal conditions for inducing gene expression during mid-log phase, which is the optimal growth stage for synthetic circuit activity. However, current PACE-compatible bioreactors are either cost-prohibitive or require significant technical expertise. Here, we present the OptoPACE Bioreactor (OPB), a low-cost, user-friendly turbidostat system optimized for PACE and optogenetic control. The OPB uses a 650 nm laser and photoresistor to measure turbidity, an Arduino microcontroller for feedback control, and NeoPixel LEDs to enable multispectral optogenetic stimulation. Designed with 3D-printed components and off-the-shelf electronics, the system operates with a single peristaltic pump and uses the siphon effect to simplify fluidics. A custom motor control shield and an LCD-rotary encoder interface enable code-free operation. The OPB supports dual bioreactors connected unidirectionally, ensuring continuous culture while maintaining precise control over optical inputs and nutrient flow. The entire system can be built for under $200, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for labs interested in continuous evolution. By combining affordability, modularity, and ease of use, the OptoPACE Bioreactor provides a robust platform for protein engineering and synthetic biology, enabling broader adoption of advanced continuous evolution methods like PACE.

Introduction:
Continuous bacterial culture bioreactors are widely employed in biological research, with recent applications in the DE of biomolecules [1, 3]. In a typical DE experiment, bioreactors  maintain a population of microorganisms in a metabolically active state to support growth and expression of synthetic biological programs. For methods like PACE, two tandem bioreactors are needed: one for growing a substrate culture that feeds into a second “lagoon” to support bacteriophages actively evolving. 
For PACE, maintaining the substrate culture at a steady state gives consistent conditions for DE, requiring either a chemostat or turbidostat control system. Chemostat bioreactors are simpler in that they supply a steady state of nutrients, while a turbidostat makes continual adjustments based on feedback—namely, culture density or turbidity [8, 9, 17]. Turbidostats allow for more optimal and customizable culture conditions but require continual monitoring and control hardware for adjustments based on feedback.
Turbidity is typically measured by optical density (OD), which reflects both light absorption by molecules in the culture, such as pigments, and light scattering from materials with different refractive indexes, typically cell membrane lipids. OD serves as a real-time quantitative assay of cell concentration, allowing researchers to infer the growth stage of the bacterial population. In a bacterial culture, OD measurements typically begin with exponential growth, reach mid-log phase, and eventually flatten out into “death phase” as resources become limited. For the production of recombinant proteins at experimental and industrial scales, mid-log phase is considered the optimal state for inducing protein expression or a synthetic biological program. In a turbidostat bioreactor, continuous monitoring of bacterial growth allows users to identify the mid-log phase, input nutrients to maintain this optimal point, and induce expression of biological circuits.
Induction of biological circuits presents another layer of control required in a bioreactor. Historically, this has meant adding specific sugars or their chemical analog to regulate bacterial operons to initiate expression [2, 16]. This requires an additional chemostat input for the induction agent. More recently, optogenetic circuits—based on biology from plants and cyanobacteria—allow for the induction of gene expression using light. Current developments in synthetic biology have even enabled wavelength-specific optogenetic circuits. With stable culture conditions and multiple biological control inputs, bioreactors could control several genetic circuits simultaneously [4, 10, 11, 14].
Despite their potential, experimental-scale turbidostat bioreactors are not commonly available. The literature indicates that establishing a functional PACE workflow often requires years of effort due to the dual challenges of designing effective synthetic biological circuits and building reliable hardware to support culture [12, 13]. Additional obstacles—such as extensive setup time and the need for frequent maintenance due to microbial biofilm accumulation on culture surfaces—make developing an automated PACE workflow even more difficult to implement.
Open-source bioreactors are under development, but none are specifically optimized for running PACE at low cost and with optogenetic controls. One of the earliest open-source bioreactors was developed by Riek et al., featuring an auxostat to maintain constant pH. However, the control and culture hardware were spread across multiple commercial devices, and its control unit software was not specified, limiting its adaptability for applications such as PACE [15]. The Versatile Continuous Culture Device (VCCD) later offered a more integrated, kit-based platform with software control systems in LabVIEW [7]. The Flexostat introduced 3D-printed components and an induction feature using a syringe pump, presenting the first automated control of gene expression. The device has chemo- and turbidostat capabilities but lacks additional control systems on its custom PCB [17]. The eVOLVER is a commercially available system with 16 mL-scale bioreactors, managed by Raspberry Pi and Arduino microcontrollers. However, it lacks built-in turbidostat capabilities for continuous culture and is the most expensive system short of commercial scale hardware [6, 18]. The Evolutionary biorEactor (EVE) presents a lower-cost platform by using Raspberry Pi for control. It includes chemical induction and turbidostat features, which it combines into a “morbidostat” for bacterial evolution [5]. While these bioreactors iteratively build on previous designs, very few are adaptable or specifically designed for PACE, have built-in optogenetic controls, and are entirely open source.
In this study, we present the design, construction, and validation of the OptoPACE Bioreactor (OPB)—a user-friendly turbidostat system specifically engineered to make protein engineering with PACE more accessible. Our design enables continuous bacterial culture through a simplified fluidic system and aeration via stirring. Optical density is measured continuously using a feedback circuit programmed into an Arduino microcontroller. We build on the low-cost advantages of the EVE device by leveraging the increased power of modern microcontrollers, using only an Arduino to run the control system, further reducing costs [5]. Additionally, our device expands upon the Flexostat’s use of a single peristaltic pump, which significantly lowers expenses. Previous bioreactors like the VCCD, Flexostat, and eVOLVER lack a user interface, requiring users to interact directly with code to run experiments [6, 7, 17]. To address this, the OPB includes an intuitive LCD screen and rotary encoder interface that runs predefined programs, enabling users without coding experience to operate the system. 
By utilizing 3D-printed components and off-the-shelf electronics, our design can be assembled as a kit for under $200 (~$124), compared to other bioreactors capable of PACE, which cost over $1,000. Our design emphasizes four key principles: ease of use, affordability, minimal complexity, and adaptability. These priorities ensure the system retains core functionality and reliability while remaining accessible to a broad range of researchers. By reducing the complexity and time investment required for hardware development—and allowing for easy operation after construction—our turbidostat system aims to lower the barriers to adopting continuous evolution technologies and facilitate broader advancements in protein engineering.
Overall Implementation and design
The OptoPACE Bioreactor is designed for optogenetic control of synthetic biological circuits.
Figure 1: Overview of the OptoPACE Bioreactor
The OPB  supports a media reservoir of any size with typical experiments requiring over a liter per day (Figure 1A). The reservoir feeds into the two task-specific bioreactors: a turbidostat (Figure 1B), and the lagoon (Figure 1C). A single peristaltic pump (Figure 1D) regulates outflow to sample collection or waste (Figure 1E). All elements are connected with disposable tubing and glass pasteur pipettes (Figure 1F). Both bioreactors are kept agitated using dual magnetic stir bars driven by motors originally designed for CD players controlled by a common circuit (Figure 1G). All power and control components are mounted within our custom 3D-printed housing (Figure 1H). A user interface, made with an LCD screen and rotary encoder, allows for easy user interaction with the system (Figure 1I). The OPB can be run as a stand alone device, with initial calibrations performed by the Arduino IDE (Figure 1J).

The OptoPACE Bioreactor uses the siphon effect to minimize the number of pumps needed.
Figure 2: Overview of liquid flow within the device, illustrating the media bottle, turbidostat, lagoon, and pump, with pipettes and tubing pumping liquid in the direction of the yellow arrows. The tubing must be airtight to allow the one pump at the end pushing the lagoon to waste to let negative pressure to pull liquid through the whole system. The system is only open at the beginning through an opening in the media bottle cap and at the end into waste.
The OPB has a simple flow design with all elements connected in a closed system except for one input and one output. This allows a siphon effect to drive liquid from the elevated media reservoir to the turbidostat, to the lagoon, and finally to the waste container (Figure 2A). The peristaltic pump installed between the lagoon and waste control the system’s flow rate. The turbidostat is dedicated to growing a feeder culture and maintaining steady state growth determines the flow rate of the whole system (Figure 2B). The lagoon supports phage growth and DE related biology, induced optogenetically (Figure 2C). Both the turbidostat and lagoon are equipped with two pipettes: a short one for incoming flow and a longer one to set the liquid's maximum level. These long pipettes ensure that each vessel can hold at least 40 mL of liquid, with the medial level determining the relative replacement rate between chambers. For proper flow and to avoid introducing air into the system, both the turbidostat and lagoon are pre-filled—or primed—with liquid before beginning any experiment using slight positive pressure on the media bottle. 


The OptoPACE Bioreactor uses a 650nm laser and a photoresistor to measure turbidity, and NeoPixel LEDs for multispectral control.
Figure 3: Laser, photoresistor, stir motors, and LEDs in the turbidostat and lagoon. (A,B). Side and above view of the turbidostat, showing a laser (C) passing into the photoresistor (D), over a stir motor with attached magnet (E). M3 Screws and nuts hold the laser in place so that the light placement of the laser can be adjusted with a screwdriver (F).  Side and above view of the lagoon, showing an LED ring (G), with eight RGB lights and four UV lights attached in series (G).

Both bioreactor modules have the same analog turbidity sensors and LED based optogenetic controls (Figure 3A,B).  Bacterial turbidity is read by shining a 650 nm laser through the culture and into a photoresistor (Figure 3C).  A 650 nm laser was chosen to stay outside of the activation wavelength of currently available optogenetic proteins (Table 1). It is crucial that the laser is only being scattered by turbidity and not bubbles or a vortex created by the stir motors so the laser line was placed just above the level of a standard stir bar (Figure 3E) The laser must also be calibrated to directly hit the photoresistor so rather than rely on perfect 3D printing it is held by 4 adjustable set screws (Figure 3F). Optogenetic control is achieved using NeoPixels PCB mounted LEDs (Adafruit) with programmable wavelength and intensity. Red Green and Blue lights come as integrated components attached in series to UV lights (Figure 3G) All LEDs are driven using the same Neopixels drivers for Arduino and controlled from a single pin. 



The OptoPACE Bioreactor is controlled by a single Arduino microcontroller and a custom designed motor control shield.
Figure 4: A: Overview of the circuit, illustrating each component and its connections. B: Inside of the electronics compartment, depicting the bottom of the custom soldered motor shield (A), which connects to the Arduino (B).
All sensing, control, and interface circuits for the OPB are a self-contained system (Figure 4A,B).  The OPB simplified design enables a single Arduino microcontroller to manage both pulse-width modulation (PWM) for device control and analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) for sensing (Figure 4C), interfacing with a custom-designed analog circuit board (Figure 4D). The whole system  is powered by a single AC/DC converter with dual 5V/12V outputs (Meanwell) (Figure 4E,F). The 5V supply powers stir motors via PWM pin 5 triggering a MOSFET (Figure 4G), LEDs through a polarized capacitor from the board, controlled by PWM from pin 6 (Figure 4H), LCD screen controlled via analog pins A4 and A5 (Figure 4I), rotary encoder/button interface connected to PWM pins 2, 3, and 4 (Figure 4J shown as two components for the schematic but functioning as one), a laser (Figure 4K), and a photoresistor to pin A0 (Figure 4L). The 12V source powers the pump triggered by a MOSFET controlled by PWM pin 9) (Figure 4M). The main electronics within the OptoPACE bioreactor can be contained within a 6.5in (165.1mm) x 4.5in (114.5mm) x 1.75in (44.45mm) height 3d-printed housing. We chose an Arduino with headers for ease of assembly and similarly used header pins on the circuit board. Similarly, both 5V and 12V wires are connected to larger 5.5mm x 2.1mm barrel power supply connectors for external power input, but both power supplies share a common ground (Figure 4N).
The OptoPACE Bioreactor uses an LCD screen and rotary encoder as an interface.
Figure 5: LCD screen and rotary encoder user interface menu options overview
To make the OPB a better stand alone device we added an interface to select from multiple programs or to terminate the current run (Figure 5). The user interface allows for a PACE experiment to be run (Figure 5A), or for a calibration experiment, where photoresistor readings can be collected and read in the Serial monitor of the IDE to read out a growth curve and find a mid log growth value (Figure 5B). Furthermore, the LED colors can be set (Figure 5C), and a cleaning program initiated (Figure 5D). Cleaning is done by running 10% bleach throughout the system between runs, however for a new experiment, all glass parts that contact cultures should be autoclaved and all tubing replaced. Finally, PACE or calibration experiments in process, can be terminated (Figure 5E). The user interface is highly adaptable within the code, allowing for menus to be changed or more to be added.
Quality control
Calibration
The turbidostat bioreactor of the OPB must have a continuous feedback control circuit from the photoresistor sensor to the pump. In our calibration experiments, we monitored the voltage readings of the photoresistor over 8 hours to evaluate its dynamic range and system noise (Figure 6). Light scattering lowered the voltage readings by 2 fold over the first 5 hours, following an inverted curve typical of bacterial growth. Noise was less than 1% of signal over the time course with rare spikes in early measurements. These were likely due to bubbles from stirring that disappeared as the culture became more viscous. 
We then chose a set point at the estimated mid-log point of the growth curve and reset the system for turbidostat mode. Initial readings were slightly higher than the initial calibration, but followed the same curve until reaching the set point, where the pump engaged to dilute the culture and reduce the optical density. The turbidostat maintained the set point with less than 1% deviation from its set point for the duration of the experiment. The system should effectively keep the optical density of the culture stable as long as there is fresh media, however if media does run out, the turbidostat fails by reverting back to a bioreactor.

maintaining mid-log growth with the turbidostat (blue). Midlog growth was measured 
at 475 based off of the blue curve.

General testing:
We further tested hardware functionalities that are not directly essential to the precision operation of the hardware but expand on the overall performance and usability of the OPB. A cleaning function was added to the system, running the pump continuously to circulate a bleach solution for small cleanings. While useful for removing biofilm buildup, this cleaning cycle would be insufficient for sterilization between experiments which requires autoclaving of all components that contact microbes. Wear testing revealed that continually changing glass pipettes led to decreased seal integrity of rubber components, causing potential pressure leaks. To mitigate this, we recommend minimizing the removal of pipettes to preserve the fit and maintain pressure-tight conditions or have replacement stoppers after extensive use.
Testing focused on maintaining a pressure-tight system and a one-way directed flow of media to waste. The tubing underwent repeated pressure cycles to assess durability, with attention to points of potential leakage or structural weakness. The glass pipettes that determine media levels were identified as the most hazardous component, requiring careful handling, particularly when cutting to size and securing caps to maintain air-tightness. Cutting and handling glass requires user training or alternative components, such as disposable acrylic pipettes, to mitigate risk. 
Application

USE CASE: EVALUATING AN OPTOGENETIC PROMOTER IN RECOMBINANT E. COLI 

The OPB was designed for integration with optogenetic control, however these biological tools remain experimental. Towards engineering functional optogenetic circuits for DE we first used the OPB to evaluate a published optogenetic promoter system for broader use. UirS/UirR is a multicomponent optogenetic switch that is activated by 395nm light, but suppressed by 530nm light. We chose this system over other available optogenetic tools because the relevant wavelengths were outside of our laser used for turbidity measurements. DNA constructs were built to express GFP under 395nm light conditions, and expression was confirmed using fluorescence spectrophotometry (Figure 8A). Light stimulated cells had a fluorescence profile of GFP with peak emission at 515nm.
Samples were drawn from the turbidostat, kept dark apart from the 650nm laser, while the lagoon was exposed to 395nm light. At mid-log growth the turbidostat began to feed culture into the lagoon (t=0). We then took samples from both chambers over time, measured their OD600 with a spectrophotometer and their fluorescence. To confirm the fluorescence measurements weren’t artifacts we collected an emission spectrum at an excitation wavelength of 480nm. Our samples fluoresced with a peak emission at 515nm, indicating GFP expression (Figure 7A). Taking point measurements across all time points, light exposed cultures had consistently higher detected levels of GFP, indicating increased expression in the lagoon. Baseline fluorescence from the dark condition turbidostat increased by 30% from initial measurements before leveling off, representing light leakage during sample collection and the leakage of the promoter. Light stimulated lagoon measurements were consistently 25-60% higher over the time course showing the limited dynamic range for this optogenetic tool, under these conditions.

Build Details:
Availability of materials and methods:
The hardware construction utilizes readily available and commonly sourced materials, including an Arduino Uno microcontroller, two DC motors, magnetic stir bars, a NeoPixel RGB stick with eight lights, a NeoPixel UV strip, a 650 nm laser, a photoresistor, a polarized capacitor, diodes, MOSFETs, resistors, 5V and 12V power supplies, wires, a protoboard, an LCD screen, and a rotary encoder. Fluidic components include a peristaltic pump, 1 mm x 2 mm ID tubing, and 3 mm x 4 mm large diameter tubing for pipette connections. Five disposable glass pipettes are modified (two cut to 6.5 cm and two to 10 cm) using a glass cutter. Fluidic connections are secured using rubber stoppers and luer lock connectors. 
Fabrication involves 3D printing components using filament and assembly using M2 screws and nuts. Electrical components are soldered onto a protoboard. Notable specialized materials include the NeoPixel UV strip and 650 nm laser, which may require sourcing from specific suppliers such as Adafruit or other electronics vendors specializing in UV and laser components. The assembly process includes cutting of glass pipettes, soldering of connections, and integration of 3D-printed mounts to house and organize the components effectively.
In addition to a computer and access to a 3D printer, tools required for the fabrication of this device, wire cutters and strippers, wire crimps for connectors (JST and Dupont), soldering iron and solder, heat gun (for shrink-wrapping wires), glassware and stir bar, and glue adhesive. Operation of the OPB requires an autoclave, incubator, and a computer with a serial connection for calibrations.

Ease of build / Design decision:
Throughout the development process, the design of the turbidostat system underwent several iterations to prioritize modularity, ease of assembly, and cost reduction. The first design cycle involved a single plate structure for three culture flasks, which highlighted the limitations of a non-modular design, prompting a shift to a silo-based structure that allowed for component interchangeability. In the second cycle, we tested modular segments with base plates and electronic components but encountered issues with bulkiness, overheating motors, and poor wire management. This led to a third cycle, where airflow vents, snap-fit connections, and a simplified lid design were implemented to address these issues, though the snap-fit parts were fragile due to the mechanical limitations of 3D printed plastic. For liquid handling, the design evolved from a bulky gravity-fed system to a hazardous positive air pressure system, and finally to a single peristaltic pump system that maintained liquid flow via both negative pressure and gravity. This final iteration not only minimized component count, reducing costs by over 25%, but also decreased system complexity and mitigated safety risks associated with pressure buildup.
Operating software and peripherals
The hardware system is programmed using the Arduino IDE (version 1.8.19 or later, including Arduino IDE 2.0.x) with C++-based Arduino language. It is compatible with a range of Arduino-compatible microcontrollers which run firmware to control components including motors, sensors, LEDs, and pumps. The minimum version compatibility includes the Arduino AVR Boards package (v1.8.6 or later) for AVR-based boards. The microcontroller should have a minimum of 32 KB of flash memory and 2 KB of SRAM, with adequate digital and analog I/O pins to support the connected sensors and actuators.

Discussion:
Conclusions:
	We developed some key innovations over three cycles of an iterative design/build/test process. We developed a 650nm laser and photoresistor system for optical density measurements and utilized the Arduino microcontroller’s capabilities by opting for direct PWM control of motors. We opted for NeoPixels for optogenetic control LEDs, instead of developing our own LED driver circuits because of the compact form factor and active open source developer community. 
Overall, we found that a modular bioreactor design was key to device adaptability and potential user-specific customization. Keeping the design simple proved to be the most challenging aspect of our device, and every iteration involved streamlining our wiring, and finding a more intuitive interface, which we received feedback on from our student colleagues through the ASU DIYbio club.
Practical use cases highlighted safety and accessibility issues, leading to improvements like automated cleaning and calibration via the LCD-controlled clock timer and the successful adoption of a single peristaltic pump to reduce cost and physical footprint. These lessons from iteration and user feedback allowed us to develop a compact, reliable, and user-friendly system that is accessible at low cost to academic and educational labs.
Future Work
One of the difficulties with our device is maintaining that the light-emitting hardware components properly interact with available optogenetic tools. As they are now, the laser (650 nm) emits in the suppression range of the CcaS/CcaR optogenetic tool (Table 1). Utilizing a laser with a wavelength outside the range of CcaS/CcaR would allow measurements without affecting the system. In testing, CcaS/CcaR did not have a large dynamic range between light and dark states, suggesting the biological tools will require engineering before they are compatible with the OPB. Our device was built for DE with optogenetics however, and we plan to use the OPB to optimize the available biological tool set to operate around the available range of wavelengths with a broader switching capacity. Finally, while directed evolution offers incredible scale in terms of candidates, the OPB is limited to a single lagoon. Future hardware iterations will focus on parallelization and scaling of experiments through integration with other lab automation devices.
